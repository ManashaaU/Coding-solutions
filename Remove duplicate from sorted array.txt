SOLUTION:
1) we are taking two pointers i and j and iterating it towards the array and 
we are taking i-1 and j and comparing left elements as it is sorted
2) we are not checking i = 0 and j= 0 because first element is unique and it is sorted
so you don't have to check the first element 
3) return i
